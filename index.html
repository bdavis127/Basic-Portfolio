      <p>
        My name is Brett Davis. I am an aspiring UX Designer who is currently involved in a coding bootcamp at SMU in
        Dallas, Texas.
        <p>
          I have had an interest in the art of human - computer interaction since my days of Human Factors Psychology
          at the University of Central Florida. During my work at the Naval Air Warfare Center in Orlando, I researched
          methods for improving
          memory retention of data through user interface design.
          <p>
            While earning my Masters Degree in Instructional Technology at UCF, I was interested in learning how to
            optimize the rate of learning
            transfer through Computer Based Training (CBT) as it was called then. I looked for any and all
            opportunities to further my knowledge in
            this field, which led to very interesting research, such as the study of Virtual Reality. If only we had
            the technology then that they
            have now! It is truly amazing to see the latest VR gadgetry.
            <p>
              My current fascination is web development, most specifically UX Design. I enjoy working with the many
              aspects of creation involved, such as
              creating wireframes and prototypes leading up to a finished product based on specific user desires
              collected through research.
              I wish to apply my experience and knowledge I have gathered in order to further the abilities of users
              who desire a positive online experience.
              <p>
                In today's digital environment, the online world is a busy place. Every business and service out there
                is constantly demanding the
                attention of potential customers. Proper use of interface design isn't just helpful anymore. It is
                absolutely necessary. If you are in need of
                UX design services, please feel free to reach out to me using my Contact page.
