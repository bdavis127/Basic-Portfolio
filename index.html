      Hello, and welcome to my bio page.  It is wonderful to be able to reach out via the World Wide Web
      to all who are interested in learning of my experiences. 
      <p>
      On this journey, I have lived overseas in Europe and traveled across the United States.  
      I have met people along the way that truly influenced how I see the world.  
      Not only do I enjoy working among diverse groups, I feel it is very necessary to be willing and 
      able to work and live among people of diverse cultures and backgrounds.
      <p>
      Before venturing overseas, I earned a Bachelors degree in Psychology and a Masters Degree
      in Instructional Technology.  I have worked in the fields of Software Training, Instructional Design, and Research.  
      I am currently in the process of broadening my horizons by furthering my knowledge of 
      web development.  My goal is to become a web developer and apply my experience where it is useful 
      in helping organizations to better reach those in need of their services. 
      <p>
      When I'm not striving to learn the latest trends in online development, I like to practice disciplines that help to 
      maintain my physical and mental awareness, such as yoga and meditation.  I have also volunteered my services for the 
      Amrit Yoga Institute in Florida in order to give back where I have received great knowledge of spiritual well being.
