        Hello, and welcome to my professional portfolio.  My education in web development has come primarily from self study as well as my recent
        graduation from Southern Methodist University's coding bootcamp in Dallas, Texas.
            <p>
              My current fascination is web development, most specifically UX Design. I enjoy working with the many
              aspects of creation involved, such as
              creating wireframes and prototypes leading up to a finished product based on specific user desires
              collected through research.
              I wish to apply my experience and knowledge I have gathered in order to further the abilities of users
              who desire a positive online experience.
              <p>
                In today's digital environment, the online world is a busy place. Every business and service out there
                is constantly demanding the
                attention of potential customers. Proper use of interface design isn't just helpful anymore. It is
                absolutely necessary. If you are in need of
                UX design services, please feel free to reach out to me using my Contact page.
