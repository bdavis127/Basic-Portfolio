## Portfolio Projects

**Band-Aid**

**Liri-Bot**

**LIRI** searches **Bands in Town** for concerts, **Spotify** for songs, and **OMDB** for movies.

1. **`node liri.js concert-this '<artist/band name here>'`**

   * Searches the Bands in Town Artist Events API for an artist and renders the following information about each event to the terminal:

     * Name of the venue

     * Venue location

     * Date of the Event (using the format "MM/DD/YYYY")

2. **`node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`**

   * Displays the following information about the selected song in your terminal/bash window

     * Artist(s)

     * The song's name

     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

     * The album containing the song

   * If no song is provided, the program defaults to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

3. **`node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`**

   * This will output the following movie information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title
       * Year movie was released
       * IMDB Rating
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating
       * Country where movie was produced
       * Language(s)
       * Plot of the movie
       * Actors in the movie
     ```

   * If the user does not enter a movie selection, the program outputs data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

4. **`node liri.js do-what-it-says`**

     * Runs `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way".
